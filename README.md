# Vocabulary Utils

This application creates two worksheets for practing spelling words. One is an unscramble the words exercise and the other is a fill in the blanks. I created this to help my kids practice their spelling words. Giving the brain more ways of working with a certain topic is proven to help it better grasp the concepts.

## Uses

You can use the Word List page to edit the words and provide hints. Take advantage of hints to show uses of the words, synomyns, definition and even translations (we are bilingual so we also practice the spanish version).

If you know coding then feel free to download and use the data.ts file to integrate your word lists.
