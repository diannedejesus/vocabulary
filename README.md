# Vocabulary Utils

This application creates three worksheets for practing spelling words. An unscramble the words exercise, a fill in the blanks and a word search. All options will randomize the order of the list. I created this to help my kids practice their spelling words. Giving the brain more ways of working with a certain topic is proven to help it better grasp the concepts.

## Uses

You can use the Word List page to edit the words and provide hints (not requiered). Take advantage of hints to show uses of the words: synomyns, definition and even translations (we are bilingual so we also practice the spanish version).

If you know coding then feel free to download and use the data.ts file to integrate your word lists.

## Other

Currently the word search is not complete. I need to implement a diagonal left placement and do more testing.

Also if a word can't be placed it will be excluded. It will try every position and placement before excluding the word.
