# Vocabulary

This application creates worksheets for practing languages skills like spelling.

- An unscramble the words exercise,
- a fill in the blanks and
- a word search.

All options will randomize the order of the list.

I created this to help my kids practice their spelling words. Giving the brain more ways of working with a certain topic is proven to help it better grasp the concept.

## Uses

You can use the Word List page to edit the words used and provide hints (not requiered). Take advantage of hints to show information related to the words: synomyns, definition and even translations (we are bilingual so we also practice the spanish version).

If you know coding then feel free to download and use the data.ts file to integrate your word lists.

## Other

I need to do more testing.

Also in word search if a word can't be placed it will be excluded. It will try every position and placement before excluding the word.

<!--
ALL: add a refresh button
Print -> Word list: print version has a lot of space if no hint is provided.

Wordsearch: possibly easier version by using fill letter of all alphabet
word list: add a section for allowing copying and pasting a list
